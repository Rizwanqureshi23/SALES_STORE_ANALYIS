# SALES_STORE_ANALYIS

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales, customers, products, and operational performance of a retail store chain using MySQL.
The goal is to uncover valuable insights that help the store improve decision-making, enhance customer experience, and increase profitability.


# Store Background

The retail store records daily transactions including product details, order information, customer data, and delivery status. 
However, the business lacks visibility into its sales trends, customer preferences, and operational efficiency.


# Problem Statement

The store is facing several challenges due to the absence of proper data analysis:

 1. No clear understanding of top-selling products
 2. Limited insights into customer buying patterns
 3. Uncertainty about which items generate the highest profit
 4. No visibility into delivery delays, cancellations, or operational failures

Because of these issues, the store is losing opportunities to increase revenue, improve customer satisfaction, and streamline operations.

# Solution 

To address these challenges, I performed a detailed analysis using MySQL. The dataset was cleaned, structured, and explored through various SQL queries.

The analysis delivered the following value:
1. Identified best-selling and slow-moving products
2. Discovered customer behavior and purchase preferences
3. Highlighted most profitable items and revenue drivers
4. Analyzed delivery performance, cancellations, and returns
5. Exposed operational inefficiencies affecting the business

This data-driven approach enables the store to optimize inventory planning, make informed decisions, improve customer experience,
and enhance overall profitability.
